A backend system that demonstrates asynchronous job processing using Redis + BullMQ, with retry handling, background workers, and job status polling via REST APIs.

This project is designed to showcase real-world backend patterns such as:

1)async task execution
2)background workers
3)retry & backoff strategies
4)stateless APIs
5)database-backed job state
